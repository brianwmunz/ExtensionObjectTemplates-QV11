ExtensionObjectTemplates-QV11
==============

Repository for storing the code for the extension object templates for QlikView v11.

Here are two extension object templates I created in order to, hopefully, make it easier to get started building extensions.  There are two templates that can be used:

**template.qar** is meant to be an easy way for people to see a wider variety of properties and functions, and is meant to be more of a learning tool.  If you're just getting started, I'd recommend taking a look at this extension and reading the Extension Object Basics document.  
 
**template_simple.qar** is more bare bones and meant to be used as a starting point for developing new extensions.  By copying and pasting this template (then changing the appropriate paths and names), you should be able to get started faster in creating an extension
 
Feel free to change any of these extensions, update the documentation, add comments, etc.  I want this to be useful so if I've missed anything, just let me know.
